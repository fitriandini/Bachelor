Matlab code for The Optimization of 3D Surface Reconstruction using
neural network-based photometric stereo (NN-based-PS).

This project aims to:
- optimize the implementation of NN-based-PS using matrix based
computation instead of the conventional for-loop iteration
- analyze the process of combining the surface-normal and the albedo
using PCA, vector addition, and surface mean.

The face images used are from yalefaces database B.

The main algorithm of NN-based PS was based on paper:
Neural-Network-Based Photometric
Stereo for 3D Surface Reconstruction, Wen-Chang-Chen.2006.
